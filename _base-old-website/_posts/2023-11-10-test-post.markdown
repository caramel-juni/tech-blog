### IN OFFICE (tue 7th Nov)

**MAKE BACKUP OF EXISTING CONFIG!!!!!**

then…

1. Open tabs &/or screenshot to preserve settings for the interface’s: 
    1. **Interface Settings**
    2. **DHCP Server settings & any static mappings**
2. Unassign an interface via Interfaces > Assignments > Delete
3. Redo that interface by making a VLAN with the corresponding tag (all under interface lagg0):
    - WAN: VLAN 10
    - ~~LAN (ADLMGMT) - VLAN 20 **(note - this is for**~~
    - ~~ADLSALES - VLAN 60~~
    - ~~ADLOFFICE - VLAN 70~~
    - ~~ADLGUEST - VLAN 75 **(as is on the**~~

…********************as well as in******************** Interfaces > Switches > VLANs, the section dictating **what VLAN tags the ports on the pfsense assign to each network.** Ensure to tag each with:

- **9t,10t** (both trunked lagg ports, must be present on all to enable loadbalancing)
- **plus** the corresponding port number (1-8) it’s plugged into on the pfsense box (ETH3, etc.)
    - WAN: ETH Port 1 (yellow)
    - MGMT **(LAN)**: ETH Port 2 (purple)
    - SALES: ETH Port 6 (orange)
    - ADLOFFICE: ETH Port 7 (White)

IF you want a port to pass all traffic & ******************NOT TAG IT, must be assigned as a TRUNK PORT:******************

- FOR THE ADLOFFICE PORT (Port 7), **ONLY PUT 9t,10t.**
    
    This is, because in my case I have external devices doing the VLAN tagging (Unifi WAPs), so I do **NOT** want the pfsense to add extra tags/override the ones added by the WAP as it will override and confuse itself.
    
    This means the VLAN tags attached to the traffic are **only assigned at the UniFi WAP** based on what SSID the device is connected to - VLAN 70 for Staff Network & VLAN 75 for Guest Network), and the **pfSense port ETH7 just passes all traffic through**.
